            <h2>Smart meters</h2>
            <p>
                A <b>smart meter</b> is automated equipment installed in smart home for calculating
                the energy consumption of various commodities such as gas, water, and
                electricity (<strong>Sun</strong> et <abbr title="others">al.</abbr>). It receives pricing information and load forecasting
                from the utility company while displaying all the information in the
                in-home-display (<abbr title="in-home-display">IHD</abbr>) (<strong>Asghar</strong> et <abbr title="others">al.</abbr>).

                <h2>System Model</h2>
                <p>
                    In the proposed scheme, a residential area with multiple smart homes is considered,
                    where multiple <abbr title="Smart Meters">SMs</abbr> are used. The usage data is
                    recorded in the <abbr title="Smart Meters">SMs</abbr> periodically. The entire system
                    consists of four entities:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Smart Meters (<abbr title="Smart Meters">SMs</abbr>)</li>
                    <li>Encryption server (<abbr title="Encryption server">ES</abbr>)</li>
                    <li>Data Aggregator (<abbr title="Data Aggregator">DA</abbr>)</li>
                    <li>Control Center (<abbr title="Control Center">CC</abbr>)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <abbr title="Smart Meters">SMs</abbr> is responsible for embedding the watermark in the
                    original data and sending to the <abbr title="Encryption server">ES</abbr>.
                    <abbr title="Encryption server">ES</abbr> encrypts the watermarked data and sends it
                    back to <abbr title="Smart Meters">SMs</abbr>. Before sending the data to
                    <abbr title="Data Aggregator">DA</abbr>, <abbr title="Smart Meters">SMs</abbr>
                    preprocess it. After receiving data from all the <abbr title="Smart Meters">SMs</abbr>,
                    <abbr title="Data Aggregator">DA</abbr> aggregates the watermarked encrypted data and
                    sends it to <abbr title="Control Center">CC</abbr> eventually.
                    <abbr title="Control Center">CC</abbr> decrypts and extracts the total consumption data
                    after verification and stores it for future analysis.

                    An attacker can try to gain unauthorized access to <abbr title="Smart Meters">SMs</abbr>
                    data for various dishonest purposes. We denote the attacker as A, where he/she may
                    attempt the following attacks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Eavesdropping</b>: A can eavesdrop on the transmission channel between the
                    system entities to access daily lifestyle and behavior of the user for crime
                    purposes.</li>
                    <li><b>Man-in-the middle</b> attack (<abbr title="Man-in-the middle">MitM</abbr>):
                    A can intercept the messages sent between the system entities to retrieve, discard, or
                    modify the <abbr title="Small Meters">SMs</abbr> data.</li>
                    <li><b>Replay</b> attack: A can perform replay attacks on the network to resend,
                    replay or delay an <abbr title="Smart Meters">SM</abbr>'s report maliciously.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
            <p>
                This paper presents the novel <b>WaterCrypt</b> scheme for privacy preserving data
                aggregation based on reversible watermarking and <strong>Paillier</strong> encryption. A reversible
                watermarking approach is used to preserve the integrity of the user fine grained data.
                Considering that can provide well-grounded security to the data in one hand, and the limited
                computational capability of <abbr title="Smart Meters">SMs</abbr> on the other hand, we
                introduced another entity in the system: encryption server.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>WaterCrypt</b> protocol provably protects the system from various attacks such as
                eavesdropping, replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, and masquerading. Physical attacks
                like false data injection are also taken into consideration. Moreover, the computational
                time is significantly small. Using reversible watermarking, the <b>WaterCrypt</b> protocol performs
                better than other recent schemes. After analyzing the security and privacy requirements and
                evaluating performance, it can be concluded that we have successfully implemented a suitable
                and secure scheme for resource-constrained smart metering systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                For future work, the focus will be on high frequency smart meters where the usage data are
                generated very frequently. We aim to employ reversible watermarking using difference
                expansion for this kind of smart metering systems.
